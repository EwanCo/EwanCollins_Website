Sound creation and re-design for Shin Godzilla (2016).
The source sound for the roar is a teacup being rubbed, recorded ultrasonically with a sonorous objects s.104
These mics are very useful for ultrasonic recording, without the expense of a Sanken CO-100K. Very useful for field recording, as you can be less precious with a cheaper and lighter microphone.

I used this video recently as a demo in my composition workshop talk about sound design and the composition of non-musical sounds. Sound design is a topic many composition students don't seem to consider until they see some examples and realise how awesome it is. This clip was designed to show that.
