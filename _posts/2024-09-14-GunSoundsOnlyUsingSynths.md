Reverb can help make white noise into gunshot sounds. On this basis I used only synthesizers (vital and serum) to create all the sounds you hear in the video. Hopefully this video is useful to you.

Figuring out how to synsthesise complex and realistic sounds using only simple oscilaltors, noise, and filtering is very useful to get a good grasp of how the sound fundamentally functions, and provokes a lot of ideas on how these techniques can be used alongside the more typical approaches.

I made this while on a sick day so it's not the most precise thing ever, but it is still useful.
