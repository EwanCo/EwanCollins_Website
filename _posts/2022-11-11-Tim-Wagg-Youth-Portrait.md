## Short Film / Art Installation

#### Date: 2022
#### Location: Auckland Art Gallery, Toi o Tāmaki
#### Roles: Music Composition and Production; Dialogue Editor; Post Production Audio

This 2022 short film was commissioned for the Chartwell Show – Walls to Live Beside, Rooms to Own.
The film centres on Jadyn Dixon, a young real estate agent, and his ideas on work, life, business, and the professional philosophy that guides his life.
The film was presented inside a skeletal house structure at the entrance to the exhibition. The work played on-loop so that audiences could come at 20 minute intervals to view.

A large focus for my original score throughout was to capture the dynamic between reality and constructed fantasies. The various interviews throughout are presented in a style that imitates reality TV and documentary, whilst also being elevated and cinematic, this contrast is an important aspect of the film and so was brought out and emphasised within the music.
In an early meeting with director, Tim Wagg, he described a style of "Amano-core" music — the soulful and yet lifeless background music heard in central city restaurants. Aspects of this style are brought into the music to reflect a corporate and impersonal feel. However, this music builds progressively and adds many transcendental and emotional elements too to reflect Dixon’s enthusiasm and determination.
This forces the musical writing and sound design to carefully balance between sincerity and lifelessness. The music supports the dialogue throughout, but also suggests that it shouldn’t be taken at face value.
