The soundtrack for Red Mole: A Romance is available now on streaming.

This music from the film is something I am very proud of. I am happy to have this release in soundtrack form. Within the rapid pace of the film it is easy to miss a lot of the detail in these works, especially since so many of the cues are so short and fleeting. As an album, every track gets the spotlight. I hope you enjoy!

Red Mole: A Romance is Ewan Collins’ original score and soundtrack to Anne Goldson’s NZIFF-featured film of the same name. Jean McAllister and Lauren Collins also feature.
The original score follows the Red Mole theatre-troupe throughout the documentary, accompanying and slotting-between archival footage of Red Mole’s own performances.
The score accentuates Red Mole’s greatest moments and underlying romances. The track Warning Messages captures the excitement, thrill, and anxieties of the troupe’s relocation to New York. The Big Change and Numbered Days cover Red Mole at their most brilliant, putting on avant-garde and forward-thinking live shows.
However, Red Mole’s story is also a tragedy. Opening Theme begins the film with the sombre and fragile, hinting at what will culminate in the washy and devastating ambience of Alan & Sally.

In Signs of All closes the film with a dark reinterpretation of the main theme, with a poetic and sweeping vocal from Lauren Collins that leaves the audience contemplating what is left behind when the show is over. 

Thanks for having a listen!
