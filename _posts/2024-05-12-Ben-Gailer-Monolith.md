Ben Gailer and the Auckland Jazz Orchestra are proud to present Monolith, a menagerie of jazz orchestra works composed and arranged by Gailer. I helped produce and wholly mixed the album.

Ben's compositions are layered and symphonic, with dense harmonies and contrapuntal textures complimenting sweeping melodies and soaring solos. His voice as a jazz pianist is also intrinsic to the character of his music.

On this album I worked as producer, mixing engineer, and mastering engineer.
As producer, I supervised recording sessions, and played a large role in the editing, processing, and even sound design present on the finished record. My role extended beyond that of a mix engineer; we made a lot of sonic choices that required more production elements.

The mix is quite unconventional for a big band album, enjoy!
