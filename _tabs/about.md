The sounds of film, games, and the world have always captured my attention, and so it is no surprise the worlds of sound design, music, mixing, and audio post production caught my eye (or ears).
​

I hold a Master's Degree in Music Composition with First Class Honours, where I focussed on perceptual studies of sound to better understand how audiences respond and react to music and sound design. This is all to approach the question that guides all my work:
​

*What can be done to direct audiences' perception towards the experience we want to share?*
​

I believe sound is one of the most evocative modes of communication. Whether it is to tell a new story, or enhance the stories of others, sound is my way of sharing and contributing to storytelling.
